# Fake News Detector

This project aims to be non-partisan and fair in it's access to data and methodology. It aims to judge an article on quality by looking at factors such as:
- Who wrote the article?
- Who published the article?
- What are the political leanings of the author/publisher?
- Are the sources for the article internal or external?
- What external sources are saying about the issue the article on?

Eventually, it will score articles on their sources to and provide some context on why it made the decision.

## How do I add a site?

1. Sites are kept in [server/sites](https://github.com/cbelsole/fakenewsdetector/tree/master/server/sites) as a flat file for configuration for now.

```js
{
  "corp": [], // hostnames of corporate affiliated sites
  "advertizer": [], // hostnames of advertizers to filter out of results
  "ignore": [], // ignored hostnames
  "articleSelector": "css selector", // css selector to find the article text
  "authorSelector": "css selector" // css selector to find the author of the article
}
```
2. Add the site to the list of supported sites in [server/conf/sites.yaml](https://github.com/cbelsole/fakenewsdetector/tree/master/server/conf/sites.yaml)
3. Add corporate information for the site to [server/conf/corporations.yaml](https://github.com/cbelsole/fakenewsdetector/tree/master/server/conf/corporations.yaml)

yarn install && cd client && yarn install && cd ..
yarn run dev
```
